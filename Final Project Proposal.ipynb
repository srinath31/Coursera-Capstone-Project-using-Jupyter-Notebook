It therefore, becomes very important to serve the customers with the best possible pricing based on the area of the house.<br><br>\nKeeping these points in mind, following business questions can be answered with the help of this analysis.<br>\nWhat can we learn about different hosts and areas? What can we learn from predictions? (ex: locations, prices, reviews, etc)? What can we learn about the impact of nearby venues to the house location, do they impact pricing and so on.<br><br>\nIn short, I am going to predict the price of a housing listed on Airbnb using all the information available with me. Also, I would be leveraging **Foursquare API** for getting the list of venues in a radius of 500 meters of a particular Airbnb house.\n"
